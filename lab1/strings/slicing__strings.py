# You can return a range of characters by using the slice syntax.
# Specify the start index and the end index, separated by a colon, to return a part of the string.

#Get the characters from position 2 to position 5 (not included):

b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:5])

#Slice From the Start
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[:5])

#Slice To the End
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[2:])

#Negative Indexing
b = "Hello, World!"
print(b[-5:-2])
